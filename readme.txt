Enhance your website’s accessibility and SEO with AI-powered alt text generation, automatically adding descriptive alt text to images in WordPress.

== Description ==

Improve your WordPress site's accessibility and search engine optimization with the **AI Alt Text Generator**, a powerful plugin that automatically generates meaningful alt text for images. By leveraging AI-driven analysis, this plugin ensures that every image in your media library is assigned a relevant, descriptive alt tag—enhancing usability for visually impaired users and optimizing your content for search engines.

Unlike manual alt tag entry, which can be time-consuming and inconsistent, our plugin streamlines the process by detecting missing alt text and automatically filling them in with AI-generated descriptions. You can choose to apply this feature **on upload** for real-time optimization or run **bulk updates** via scheduled CRON jobs for existing media libraries.

The plugin also provides an intuitive settings page, allowing you to customize AI keyword seeding, preferred language for descriptions, and automated execution preferences. For site owners managing large image collections, **batch processing ensures efficiency**, while real-time updates keep your workflow uninterrupted.

### Key Features:

- **AI-Powered Alt Text Generation**: Automatically generates relevant alt text for images using an AI-driven approach.
- **On-Upload & Bulk Processing**: Choose to apply alt text generation instantly on upload or in scheduled bulk cleanups.
- **Multilingual Support**: Generate alt text in multiple languages, configurable via the settings panel.

- **Seamless Integration**: Works natively within the WordPress Media Library, requiring no manual intervention.
- **CRON Job Automation**: Enable background processing for large media libraries without impacting performance.
- **Analytics Dashboard**: Track the number of alt text generated with an integrated stats panel.

With **AI Alt Tags Generator**, your images will always have **accurate and SEO-friendly descriptions**, improving accessibility, compliance, and search rankings—all without extra effort.
